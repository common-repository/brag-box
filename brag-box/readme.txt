Create a module that allows logged-in users to post something nice about a fellow user, friend or co-worker.

== Description ==

The Brag Box is the perfect solution for spreading the love and promoting positivity throughout your user-based website. Simply paste the `[brag-box]` shortcode into the content editor or widget area of your choice, visit the page you posted it on, and brag about a fellow user, friend and/or co-worker who deserves it!

> Users must be logged into WordPress to submit brags. This keeps users accountable for their submissions and helps prevent spam posts from unknown sources.

### Features:
* **Quick and Easy Brag Creation** - Simply fill out the two Brag Box input fields, click the 'Submit Brag' button, and that's it. Your brag will now be available for all visiting users to see.
* **User Specific Brag Deletion** - Easily delete brags posted from your account with our front-end trash button, perfect for accidental submissions or brags with typos. The front-end trash button will only be available for your brags, so you need not worry about other non-admin users deleting your submissions.
* **Hide Brags with One Click** - Admins can easily hide brags from the brag box by clicking 'Move to Trash' from the WordPress admin panel. Although brags wonâ€™t show in the brag box once moved to the trash, we still save them for your personal record keeping.
* **Real-Time Brag Filtering** - Find what you need in an instant without having to reload the page.
* **Instant Response Time** - Submit, delete, and filter brags, all without reloading the page.
* **Mobile & Responsive** - Functional across all device sizes.
